# 2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass
A project following along with the "2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass" class by Jose Portilla on Udemy.

Progress = 11/235

## Notes and learnings from the tutorial

## ML Pathway Overview
- Supervised learning = trying to predict an outcome
- Unsupervised learning = dicover patterns in data

## NumPy
Many many Data Science libraries are built powered by NumPy.
It is a library for creating N-dimensional arrays.
- NumPy structures look similar to python lists but they are much more efficient.
